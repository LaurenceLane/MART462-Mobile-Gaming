  I'm not entirely sure I went through the whole tutorial since it kept bugging out, but I think I've got the general layout of the program. 
It's the same style of site as WordPress and other website building sites.
  While they're fairly simple to start off with for beginners, they're pretty limiting beyond that. There's only so many features available, 
even counting ones you have to pay to access. There's limited customization beyond the basics, such as text and general layout. Not to 
mention them being expensive.
  When making a mobile program, you have to keep in mind that compared to a PC, most phones aren't as capable of handling large files and
multiple programs running in the background. So you have to make sure you're not getting ahead of yourself, so you don't have to scrap a
bunch of work that isn't usable.
